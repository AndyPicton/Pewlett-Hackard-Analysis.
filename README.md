# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview

At Pewlett-Hackhard, I have been asked to analyze employee information to help the company plan for a mass employee retirement. I organized soon to be retirees by department to help the company PH come up with a mentorship program to let the soon to be retirees move down to part time to help train new hires. 

### Results: 
- There will be 72,458 employees retiring in the near future
- Most titles retiring soon are Senior level
- Only 2 managers will be retiring soon
- 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program
